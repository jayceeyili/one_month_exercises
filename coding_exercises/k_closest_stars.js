  Consider a coordinate system for the Milky Way, in which Earth is at (0,0,0).
  Model stars as points, and assume distances are in light years.
  The Milky Way consists of approximately 10^12 stars, and their coordinates are stored in a file.
  How would you compute the k stars which are closest to Earth?
  Hint: Suppose you know the k closest stars in the first n stars.
  If the (n + 1)th star is to be added to the set of k closest stars, which element in that set should be evicted?
